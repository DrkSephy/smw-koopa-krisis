Super Mario World: Impact.js
----------------------------

Super Mario World: Impact.js aims to recreate the original Super
Mario World (SMW) platformer from the Super Nintendo (SNES) using
JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. Using Impact.js is a game engine which
is perfect for handling 2D graphics, collisions, and comes with its
own level editor, Weltmeister. 

This project also aims to be a foundation for a potential project 
for the CCNY Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Game Development
Special Interest Group(SIG). 

As a SMW clone, the goals are as follows:

###Side-scrolling levels
A basis of SMW. All levels will consist of left->right side-scrolling,
where the player must naviagate to the end of the level without losing
all of their lives. 

###Running/Jumping Physics
Our main player sprite(Mario) will have all movement handlers fully
functional(Running, Jumping, Swimming). Flying will be disabled due
to potential level-breaking capabilities. 

###Power-ups
A staple of SMW: power-ups. The following power-ups are planned:

    * **Mushroom**      -> The standard power-up, makes Mario bigger.
    * **Fire Flower**   -> Shoots fire balls (2 MAX on screen). 
    * **Feather**       -> Will be disabled to make levels non-skippable.

###Enemy AI
A huge part of this project will be to create enemies for the player to
encounter. A slew of planned enemies are as follows:

    * **Goomba**        -> The standard SMW enemy. Moves from right to left.
    * **Koopa**         -> Another classic enemy. Moves/jumpbs from right to left.
