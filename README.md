Super Mario World: Impact.js
----------------------------

Super Mario World: Impact.js aims to recreate the original Super
Mario World (SMW) platformer from the Super Nintendo (SNES) using
JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. Using Impact.js is a game engine which
is perfect for handling 2D graphics, collisions, and comes with its
own level editor, Weltmeister. 

This project also aims to be a foundation for a potential project 
for the CCNY Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Game Development
Special Interest Group(SIG). 

###Installation
In order to run this game, you will need a copy of the Impact.js library,
which can be purchased for 99$ here: http://impactjs.com/buy-impact
In order to use the built-in Tile Editor Weltmeister, you will need to
make sure that Apache and PHP are running on your machine. Instead of
using Apache, there is a python script included in this project named
"Server.py", which is a self-contained web server specifically for
running the impact.js game file as well as Weltmeister. For more
information, Server.py can be found at: https://github.com/amadeus/python-impact.


###Power-ups
A staple of SMW: power-ups. The following power-ups are planned:

* **Fire Flower**   -> Shoots fire balls (2 MAX on screen). 
   

###Enemy AI
A huge part of this project will be to create enemies for the player to
encounter. A slew of planned enemies are as follows:

* **Goomba**        -> The standard SMW enemy. Moves from right to left.
* **Koopa**         -> Another classic enemy. Moves/jumpbs from right to left.

###Future Development
Although this project's original plans are to re-create Super Mario 
World using Javascript, this is only the core design. The final goal
would be to create a side-scrolling action RPG, similar to Legend of
Zelda 2. Regarding storyline, that may be tacked on at the end, or 
possible proposed. As for now, the game will simply progress as a 
straightforward platformer. The proposed add-ons are as follows:

#####Level-up System
Incorporate a level-up system where stats such as health, strength,
defense, speed (something akin to Fire Emblem?) increase upon level
ups. Normally, score doesn't serve an actual purpose in a Mario game.
However, we'll use the score counter as a basis of level-up milestons,
just like Super Paper Mario did. Whether the player's stats will 
increase randomly (Fire Emblem) or selectively is to be determined.

#####Add Weapons
Naturally, an action RPG would require some sort of inventory of weapons.
Swinging a sword would be ideal (and really cool), but perhaps creating
a magical weapon which fires bolts would be simpler for a starting point.

#####Inventory
An inventory of stored items. Some items which would be ideal:

* **Mushroom**        -> Recovers health by X amount.
