/*
Basic AI
--------
This module contains the barebones AI most enemy entities should have. It will
not contain the main AI via the update() function since those should be handled
by enemy entities themselves. This setup provides a centralized module for quickly
modifying shared AIs across all enemy entities. Enemy entities containing more
advanced AIs may be exempt from this structure (i.e., enemies with "spiky" property
may still use this basic AI module but may need to override some of its behaviors).
