/*
Flying Yellow Koopa
-------------------
1. If player is near enemy but NOT in enemy's line-of-sight (LoS), enemy
   ignores player and uses default AI.
     a. Enemy's LoS is a rectangular field-of-view directly in front of itself.
2. If player is near enemy AND is in enemy's LoS, enemy begins following player
   and extends its detection range.
     a. If enemy is following player and player moves behind enemy, enemy faces
        player and continues to follow.
3. If enemy is following player and player steps out of enemy's detection
   range, enemy stops following player and resets to default AI.
