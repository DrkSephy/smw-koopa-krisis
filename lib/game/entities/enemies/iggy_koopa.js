Iggy Koopa
----------
A boss featuring the combination of AIs from existing enemies:
  1. [Modified] Stalker AI from Flying Yellow Koopa.
  2. [Modified] Protection/Spiky state from Bony Beetle (new).
  3. Linear attack projectile from Bullet Shooter.
  4. [Modified] Multiple attack projectiles from Hammer Bros.
  5. Skipping (jumping while moving) AI from Flying Green Koopa.
  5. [Modified] Randomized jumping from Jumping Ninji.

Custom AIs:
  1. Multiple health-based AI stages.
  2. Anti-"I cannot reach player" AI.
  3. Anti-"hammer/fireball damage abuse" AI.
  4. Derived from stalker --> Waits until provoked by player or if player is near.
  5. Derived from protection/spiky state --> Random protection/spiky state duration.
  6. Derived from protection/spiky state --> Panick state.
  7. Derived from randomized jumping --> Random jump frequency with random jump height.
  8. Derived from linear attack projectiles --> linear attack projectiles with random spread.


----- Initial/Basic AI -----
1. Enemy will initially remain stationary until player comes within detection
   range or enemy is provoked (such as if player attacks from afar).
2. If enemy has lost track of player, enemy defaults to basic left/right
   movement. Enemy will move in the opposite direction if it collides with an
   obstacle.

----- Detection AI -----
3. If player is near enemy but NOT in enemy's line-of-sight (LoS), enemy
   ignores player and uses default AI. Enemy's LoS is a rectangular
   field-of-view directly in front of itself.
4. If enemy detected player (either by distance or by provoke), enemy begins
   following player and extends its detection range.
   a. If enemy is following player and player moves behind enemy, enemy faces
      player and continues to follow.
   b. If enemy is following player and player steps out of enemy's detection
      range, enemy stops following player and resets to default AI.

----- Randomized Jumping while Moving AI -----
5. Enemy will jump while moving.
6. Enemy will jump random heights at random intervals.
   a. Enemy may jump when firing its attack causing attack projectiles to be
      launched at jump height.
   b. If player is above enemy for too long (enemy cannot reach player), enemy
      will increase its average jump height (still random) in an attempt to
      overcome obstacle.

----- Protection/Shell State AI -----
7. If the player jumps on enemy when enemy is NOT in shell state, enemy will
   take damage and enter shell state (a spinning shell).
   a. In shell state, if the player jumps on enemy, player takes extra damage.
   b. Enemy will unhide (exit shell state) and revert back to default AI after
      some time has passed regardless if player is near enemy or not.
   c. Enemy duration in shell state is determined by its current AI state. The
      higher the AI state (the lower the enemy's health is), the longer the
      duration.
   d. Panick state: If enemy is in panick state and enemy enters shell state,
      enemy remains in shell state indefinately until player moves far enough
      away from enemy. While in panick state, if player is still within range,
      enemy will begin to fire projectiles randomly while in shell state. As the
      enemy's health decreases, the frequency of firing random projectiles
      increases.

----- Multiple Health-based AI -----
8. Enemy has 3 sets of attack AIs: default, annoyed, and angry AI states.
   a. Default state: Enemy is notably faster than the average enemy. Enemy
      fires a single attack projectile in front of itself at random time
      intervals.
   b. Annoyed state: Enemy is slightly faster than default state, and shell time
      increases. Enemy fires three attack projectiles at same time in front of
      itself in a triangular formation. Center projectile is same as default
      state's projectile. Top and bottom projectiles have randomized spread
      angle with a linear trajectory.
   c. Angry state: Enemy is moderately faster than default state, and shell time
      further increases. Enemy fires 8 attack projectiles around itself in a
      circular formation. Each of the projectiles are fired at a difference of
      45-degree angle in a linear trajectory.
   d. Rampage state: Enemy is much faster than default state, and attack
      frequency increases. Enemy shoots a single projectile directed towards
      player's position at firing time. Enemy continues to move faster as its
      health continues to decrease.

----- Anti-camping AI -----
9. Enemy has anti-camping AIs. (camping = tactic where player obtains static
   strategic position of advantage)
   a. If player is on unreachable for long enough, enemy will fire a single attack
      projectile upwards/downwards towards player in hopes of threatening player
      above/below.
   b. Similarly from #9a, if player is unreachable for long enough, AND
      enemy is in angry state, fire the 8 projectiles formation from #8c.
   c. Enemy will not jump up if directly below player to prevent auto-taking
      damage and auto-entering shell state (due to #7).
   d. See #6b.

10. Enemy cannot be abused from non-player damage projectiles as much.
    a. Damage from non-player projectiles that hits enemy is nerfed to 1 damage.
