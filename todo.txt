Long-Term Goals
---------------

1. Create an overworld for level selection. (Not sure of a clear way to do this yet). 
2. Figure out how to traverse to different sub-rooms in a level using only one level change entity.
   i.e: There can be several doors in a level, and a player can enter them by pressing UP, and 
   travel back and forth through these maps. This feature is high priority, since it removes 
   linearity in the game.
3. Possibly adding a "climb ladder" feature.


To-do (September 20, 2013)

    - COMPLETED.

2. Ninji AI [ Kim ]

    - In progress.

3. Ledge Detection / Simple walking AI / Graphics upgrade [ David ]

    - COMPLETED. 

To-do (September 27, 2013)
--------------------------

1. Heads Up Display (HUD) upgrade [ Not taken up yet ]

   - Replace current display of lives. Instead of displaying this.lives using a loop counter, replace
     the entire life counter with simply a Mario head x # lives.
   - Add a coin counter. Could be either a graphic of a coin, with the number of coins next to it. 
     Another approach could be to simply spell out "coins". (Not sure which method looks better).
   - Add an "Item" box to the center of the hud. Based on the weapon currently held by the player, 
     draw the corresponding power-up images.

2. Kill block [ Kim ]

    - Currently, there is no way to kill an entity that falls into a bottomless pit/lava. This
      Entity will be placed under lava/pits to kill any entity that makes contact with it. For
      reference, look at how to create a box using only weltmesiter (from levelexit.js). The
      collision properties will have to be changed to check against both A and B type entities,
      and in the collidesWith() method, just call this.kill() whenever an entity collides with the
      kill block.

3. Thwomp AI [ Kim ]

    - The behavior of this enemy is located in lib/game/entities/thwomp.js.
      NOTE: The graphics for this enemy are -slightly- off. This is minor, will be fixed eventually.

4. Bullet Shooter [ Kevin ]

     - Behavior: The shooter itself will only fire if the player is a certain distance away from it.
       It will not shoot if the player is very close to it. The entity that is spawned from the 
       Bullet Shooter is the Bullet Bill entity.
       NOTE: The bullet bills go through all obstacles, and only collide with the player.

5. Bird (Needs a cooler name) [ Jorge ]

     - COMPLETED.

6. Jumping while moving forward AI [ Kevin ]

     - COMPLETED.
