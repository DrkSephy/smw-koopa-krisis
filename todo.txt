Long-Term Goals
---------------

1. Create an overworld for level selection. [David/Jorge]

   - In progress.

2. Figure out how to traverse to different sub-rooms in a level using only one level change entity.
   i.e: There can be several doors in a level, and a player can enter them by pressing UP, and 
   travel back and forth through these maps. This feature is high priority, since it removes 
   linearity in the game. [Jonathan] 

   - COMPLETED. 

3. Possibly adding a "climb ladder" feature.


To-do (September 20, 2013)
--------------------------

1. Stalker AI [ Kevin ]
    
    - COMPLETED.

2. Ninji AI [ Kim ]

    - COMPLETED.

3. Ledge Detection / Simple walking AI / Graphics upgrade [ David ]

    - COMPLETED. 

To-do (September 27, 2013)
--------------------------

1. Heads Up Display (HUD) upgrade [ David ]

   - Replace current display of lives. Instead of displaying this.lives using a loop counter, replace
     the entire life counter with simply a Mario head x # lives.
   - Add a coin counter. Could be either a graphic of a coin, with the number of coins next to it. 
     Another approach could be to simply spell out "coins". (Not sure which method looks better).
   - Add an "Item" box to the center of the hud. Based on the weapon currently held by the player, 
     draw the corresponding power-up images.

     - COMPLETED.

2. Kill block [ Kim ]

    - Currently, there is no way to kill an entity that falls into a bottomless pit/lava. This
      Entity will be placed under lava/pits to kill any entity that makes contact with it. For
      reference, look at how to create a box using only weltmesiter (from levelexit.js). The
      collision properties will have to be changed to check against both A and B type entities,
      and in the collidesWith() method, just call this.kill() whenever an entity collides with the
      kill block.

    - COMPLETED. 

3. Thwomp AI [ Kim ]

    - The behavior of this enemy is located in lib/game/entities/thwomp.js.
      NOTE: The graphics for this enemy are -slightly- off. This is minor, will be fixed eventually.

    - COMPLETED.

4. Bullet Shooter [ Kevin ]

     - Behavior: The shooter itself will only fire if the player is a certain distance away from it.
       It will not shoot if the player is very close to it. The entity that is spawned from the 
       Bullet Shooter is the Bullet Bill entity.
       NOTE: The bullet bills go through all obstacles, and only collide with the player.

    - COMPLETED.

5. Bird (Needs a cooler name) [ Jorge ]

     - COMPLETED.

6. Jumping while moving forward AI [ Kevin ]

     - COMPLETED.

To-do (October 4th, 2013 -> October 18th, 2013)
-----------------------------------------------

1. Boo Enemy [ Jorge ]

    - Stalks player when the player is not facing the boo. If the player is facing the boo, the boo will not follow.

    - COMPLETED.

2. Hammer Brothers [ Kevin ]

    - Shoots hammers periodically. 

    - COMPLETED.

3. Fire Brothers [ Kim ]

    - Shoots a series of fireballs (spread out over time), then has a cool down, then begins to fire again. 
      The graphics file to use is firebros.png. (Note: size is 24 x 24).

4. Bony Beetle [ Kevin ]

    Graphics file: new_bony_beetle.png
    Note: Size of each frame is 30 x 30.

    Behavior
    --------
    1. Plays walking frame. 
    2. If the player is getting close to it, it will transition into its spiky state.
    3. In the spiky state, if the player jumps on it then they take damage.
    4. After a few seconds, reverts to walking. 
    5. If the player jumps on it when this enemy is not spiky, it will turn into bones and regenerate after
       a few seconds.

    - COMPLETED.

5. Skeleton [ Kim ] 

    Graphics file: skeleton.png
    Note: Size of each frame is 33 x 26. 

    Behavior
    --------
    1. Walks back and forth (it does not fall off ledges, see ledge detection code).
    2. If the player jumps on it, it turns into bones.
    3. After a few seconds, it regenerates to it's normal form.

6. Fixing multiple music bug [ Jonathan ]

    - With the addition of a new "door" entity, we have lost our functionality of having different songs for
      different levels. The reason for this is that the director.js's loadlevel() method is being 
      overridded by the loadLevel() method in door.js (I think).


****************************
* List of new things to do *
****************************
As stated in my recent e-mail, if you would like to take up any of the following things, feel free to do so by 
including your name next to the task.

1. Overworld [ David / ??? ]
    
    Notes: After tinkering around with this, I'm not sure of a good way to do this. Currently, the overworld
           is a level itself which is loaded in a new "game" instance, OverWorld. I thought that by using 
           an entity on the overworld itself to load a level, it would work (unfortunately it does not). 
           After testing with including all of the director code in the OverWorld game instance, I am 
           able to load levels (although this method seems improper). I'm starting to wonder if we even
           need the director plugin anymore, as it is unclear to me exactly how levels are being loaded
           (since director has it's own loadLevel() method, which overrides ImpactJS's loadLevel() method,
           which both are then overrided again by the door.js's loadLevel() method, argh!). I will probably 
           experiment a bit more with this, but any and all ideas/attempts are welcome.

    More Notes: For reference, the reason why I used a seperate game instance for this specific level 
                is because it requires a different player sprite/controls.

2. A powerup system [ David ]

    A much needed (major) improvement. As you are aware due to programming AI, no matter how difficult the 
    enemy is, it can be defeated by having powerups at the start(espeically the hammmer). The proposed replacement system   
    for powerups is as follows:

    1. Remove all "weapons" (that is a direct reference to the source code, where powers are defined as weapons).
       (This includes removing the code that allows you to TAB through weapons, since the player cannot carry
       more than one powerup).
    2. Use the question mark block provided (questionmark_block.png) to create an entity named (Itemblock) which
       can spawn a variety of items when hit from -below-. These items include: [Mushroom, Green Mushroom,                 
       Hammer Suit, Fire Flower, X number of Coins]. The behavior of the items are as follows:

        2a. The Mushroom powerup will move randomly in either the right or left direction after being spawned, 
            so that the player has to chase it to grab it. This powerup restores 10 health points. 
            (See healthpotion.js for a code reference).

        2b. The Green Mushroom has the same behavior as the Mushroom, except that it gives the player one 
            extra life. (this.lives += 1).

        2c. The Fire Flower will give the player the ability to throw fireballs.

        2d. Ahh, the fun hammer suit. This power gives the player to destroy...the ability to throw hammers.
            
    3. The Item Blocks will have to be coded similar to the door, where you can enter a key-value pair to
       set which item comes out when hit (or else you'll have to make 4 seperate entities). 

    4. When the player picks up a power, they will now gain the ability to shoot that entity. 

    5. If the player is hit, take away the powerup. Now, the only way the player can damage enemies is by jumping 
       on them.

    
    Note: I've already included all of the necessary graphics for all of the above entities.


3. A way to pause / unpause the game.




General Notes
-------------
As of now, I don't have any good ideas for new enemies. I know that both Kim and Kevin expressed interest in the 
plant-like enemies located on this page: http://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/sma4/sheet/22919/
but there is one problem. These enemies are meant to be hidden inside pipes, and only expose themselves when
they rise up. However, due to how layering works in ImpactJS, the entity layer will always have the highest
priority and therefore these enemies will appear awkward (even if they come out of the ground). I will think
about new features and new enemies as time goes on.
