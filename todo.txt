Final List of things to do
--------------------------
We are nearing the end of Phase 1 of our game. Woo! Here is the final list of things.


1. Overworld Stuff [ ? ]

    - Test if we can load different player sprites for different levels. This
    will allow us to bypass different states.

2. Touch up all enemy Graphics, behaviors, damages and stats. [ David ]
