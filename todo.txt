Long-Term Goals
---------------


To-do (October 4th, 2013 -> October 18th, 2013)
-----------------------------------------------

1. Fire Brothers [ Kim ]

    - Shoots a series of fireballs (spread out over time), then has a cool down, then begins to fire again. 
      The graphics file to use is firebros.png. (Note: size is 24 x 24).


2. Skeleton [ Kim ] 

    Graphics file: skeleton.png
    Note: Size of each frame is 33 x 26. 

    Behavior
    --------
    1. Walks back and forth (it does not fall off ledges, see ledge detection code).
    2. If the player jumps on it, it turns into bones.
    3. After a few seconds, it regenerates to it's normal form.

      - STATUS: IN PROGRESS.

To-do (October 25th, 2013 -> November 1st, 2013)
------------------------------------------------

1. Fix bugs regarding ladder. [ Kevin? ]
  
    - I don't remember the bug, but I recall one. 

2. Add new player spawn position to ladder. [ Kevin? ]

    - Add a new key-value property to set the player's spawn position for a level.

3. Overworld. [ David ]

    - Create some sort of level selection screen. I've got a few new ideas.

* New Enemies *
***************

1. Bowser Statue [ NOT TAKEN YET ]

   - Graphics file: media/enemies/bowser_statue.png   Size: 24 x 24.
   - Behavior: Completely stationary. It spawns a flame periodically. (Flame graphic is located in enemies/flame.png.
     Note: The flame goes through all objects and only collides with the player.

2. Swooper [ NOT TAKEN YET ]

   - Graphics file: media/enemies/swooper.png         Frame sizes: 16 x 16
   - Behavior: The swooper is initally positioned hanging on the ceiling. As the player is approaching, it attempts
               to swoop down and collide with the player. If it misses, it simply keeps moving left. Frame [2] is 
               the idle state, while frames [1], [0] are the swooping animations. For a visual aid on how it works,
               check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtm9ZGcHQho
     Note: To bypass having to calculate angles for the attack, it's probably best if you target the player from as wide
     as a range as possibly, taking in mind the actual range at which an enemy will be spawned by the enemy_spawner
    entity. 

3. Pink Muncher [ NOT TAKEN YET ] 

    - Graphics file: media/enemies/pink_muncher.png  Frame sizes: 16 x 16
    - Behavior: 
              1. Detects the player.
              2. If player is not close to it (you can determine what is "too close"), it plays frames [0], [1].
              3. If the player is getting close, it starts to jump up a few pixels (playing frame [2],[3]) and
                 repeatedly jumps back up everytime it lands.
              Note: The purpose of this enemy is to jump up and try to hit the player from below as they try to
                    jump over it. It's up to the programmer to decide how high is enough, but note that the point
                    of this enemy is to make the player be cautious of how high they jump (otherwise they'll get
                    hit). 
              4. If the player is not "close", revert back to it's first two frames.
