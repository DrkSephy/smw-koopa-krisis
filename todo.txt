Final List of things to do
--------------------------
We are nearing the end of Phase 1 of our game. Woo! Here is the final list of things.


1. Add new player spawn position to pipe. [ Kevin ]

    - Add a new key-value property to set the player's spawn position for a level
      transition. This way we can spawn the player in a set location.

2. Overworld Stuff [ Kevin ]

    - Test if we can load different player sprites for different levels. This 
    will allow us to bypass different states.

    - Figure out how to store the player's state after transitioning levels.
    i.e: Save number of coins, lives, etc.

3. Touch up all enemy Graphics, behaviors, damages and stats. [ David ]s

1. Bowser Statue [ Kim ]

   - Graphics file: media/enemies/bowser_statue.png   Size: 24 x 24.
   - Behavior: Completely stationary. It spawns a flame periodically. (Flame graphic is located in enemies/flame.png.
     Note: The flame goes through all objects and only collides with the player.

2. Pink Muncher [ Kim ] 

    - Graphics file: media/enemies/pink_muncher.png  Frame sizes: 16 x 16
    - Behavior: 
              1. Detects the player.
              2. If player is not close to it (you can determine what is "too close"), it plays frames [0], [1].
              3. If the player is getting close, it starts to jump up a few pixels (playing frame [2],[3]) and
                 repeatedly jumps back up everytime it lands.
              Note: The purpose of this enemy is to jump up and try to hit the player from below as they try to
                    jump over it. It's up to the programmer to decide how high is enough, but note that the point
                    of this enemy is to make the player be cautious of how high they jump (otherwise they'll get
                    hit). 
              4. If the player is not "close", revert back to it's first two frames.
